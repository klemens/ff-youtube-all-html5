# YouTube ALL HTML5 #

With this addon you can play almost any video on YouTube as a HTML5 video.
This includes videos with monetarisation enables which normally don't play
in the html5 player.

## Usage ##

It inserts a button right besides the serachbox that you have to click when you
want to play the video. Using the menu right next to the button you can change
the size of the video.

This addon only makes sense if you have Flash disabled; otherwise all videos
will play in Flash.

Note that some videos on YouTube are only available as H264 and thus will only
play with newer Firefox versions under windows that have the
`media.windows-media-foundation.enabled` poperty set to true.
